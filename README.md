Additionally for backend maintainability uses **Mongoose** ODM. Relies on **Python** web hooks and **Flask** api run using my local machine's task scheduler to log in every day of the week, schedule a room specified to my classes and send the message to my backend -> database.

# How To Run

For each folder (except the backend folder in the Script directory) there is a **README** that may be followed to deploy the application locally.

# Deployment

Single Production Environment: Frontend/Backend deployed via **Vercel**, MongoDB database deployed via **MongoAtlas**
